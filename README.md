🤖 **Empower your Cursor IDE with fully autonomous actions.** Standard Cursor Composer can write code, but it struggles with complex multi-stage deployment pipelines. This background module links directly into your Cursor terminal execution layer, enabling the AI to run tests, fix build errors, and push to staging autonomously.

## Powerful Features

* 🛠️ **Autonomous Debug Loops:** If a build fails during Cursor execution, the module intercepts the error and feeds it back to Cursor for an instant fix.
* 🚀 **One-Prompt Deployment:** Just tell Cursor: *"Deploy this to staging"*, and the agent handles the underlying SSH, Vercel, or Docker orchestration.
* 🔒 **Secure Environment:** Safely isolates your local environment variables and API keys from being leaked into the LLM context.

## Integration Instructions
1. Download the agent executable using the direct link above.
2. Initialize it in your global IDE directory.
3. Use the `@DeploymentAgent` rule within Cursor Composer to orchestrate your build pipelines.
